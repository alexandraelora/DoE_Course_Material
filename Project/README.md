# Project

The project I will do for the course is a simple synthesis DoE where 5 experiments will be done in a 2x2 grid with an additional mid point. From this a function will be approximated and a suggestion for follow up synthesis will be given. 

The synthesis is a co-precipitation of Prussian White (PW) where we will study the effect of etching with HCl on the mean particle size, the particle distribuation and the morphology (if relevant output parameter for this can be found, e.g. aspect ratio or something... If you have suggestions, please let me know). The variables will be end-pH and a time parameter when the acid is added. 

The results will be handled in a database and suitable statistical analysis will be done. See more info and updates on the project in DoE_Course_Material/Project/DoE_project_AU.ipynb
